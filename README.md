# LeetCode Solutions Repository
**<span style="color:lightgreen">Under Progress</span>**

Welcome to my LeetCode solutions repository! This is where I solve a variety of LeetCode problems and share my detailed solutions. My goal is to provide clear and well-documented code that can help others understand different problem-solving techniques.

## Collections

In this section, I will include any specific collections or patterns that I am following. These collections are curated to cover a wide range of topics and difficulty levels, ensuring a comprehensive preparation for coding interviews.

### Current Collections:
1. **[NeetCode 150](https://neetcode.io/practice?tab=neetcode150)**: A carefully selected set of 150 problems designed to cover essential coding concepts and patterns.

## Miscellaneous Problems

This repo might contain problems that do not belong to any specific collection. These problems are categorized separately to maintain organization and make it easier to find solutions to unique or less common challenges.

## Additional Resources

Here are some valuable resources that I use to enhance my problem-solving skills and prepare for technical interviews:
- **[NeetCode.io](https://neetcode.io/)**: A platform that offers structured study plans and curated lists of coding problems, helping you systematically prepare for technical interviews.

Feel free to explore the repository and use the solutions to improve your coding skills. Happy coding!
